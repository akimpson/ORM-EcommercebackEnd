# ORM-EcommercebackEnd

## Description

- This back-end application for an e-commerce website uses an Express.js API.

- Using Sequalize you are then able to connect to the MySQL database.

- Entering the schema and seed commands a development database is created and seeded with test data.

- When the command is entered to invoke the application the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

- Open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
  and the data for each route is displayed in a formatted JSON.

- Once the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia you can successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.
